# Amazing_Frontend_MiniProjects
I wouldn't even know where to begin if someone asked me to create something beautiful from scratch! But, if a designer hands me a design I'll more than happily code it up.

If you're in the same boat, we've got some great projects for you at Frontend Mentor. Each one includes mobile & desktop designs, a front-end style guide (for fonts, colors, etc) and a basic brief. The assets are all provided and pre-optimized meaning all you need to focus on is writing the code!

You can use any tools you like while building each project. So if you're wanting to practice things like React, Vue, Sass, Tailwind you get to choose your setup.
